			<p>Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a non-profit conservation organization that focuses on the protection and conservation of sea turtles and their eggs. Located on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, the hatchery is dedicated to preserving the four species of sea turtles that come to nest on the beaches. The hatchery is involved in collecting and relocating turtle eggs to a protected area where they are carefully monitored and hatched under optimal conditions. Once the hatchlings are ready, they are released into the ocean under the watchful eye of the hatchery staff. Visitors to the hatchery can learn about the various turtle species, their behavior, and the conservation efforts that are being taken to preserve these magnificent creatures.</p>
