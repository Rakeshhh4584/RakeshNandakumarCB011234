      <p>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a non-profit organization that aims to protect sea turtles and their eggs. The hatchery is located on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka and is dedicated to preserving the five species of sea turtles that come to nest on the beaches. The hatchery collects turtle eggs and hatches them in a protected area. When the hatchlings are ready, they are released into the sea. Visitors to the hatchery can learn about the different turtle species and witness the release of the baby turtles into the ocean.</p>
